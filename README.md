# Wordlists made from Collections 1 - 5 + Antipublic
All wordlists are frequency sorted and deduped based on each collection.

I had to leave out a chunk of data due to it been in its original ``email:hash`` format

However, these would have most likely been dupes so I considered it acceptable.

## Stats
<b>Total Size:</b> Size of the frequency sorted and deduped original file

<b>Only commons:</b> Size of the file after it was tested with the rest, and outputted only the common lines 

<b>% common:</b> How much of the original file was the same after checking for commons

<b>% decrease:</b> How much of the original file wasn't common (e.g. only occured once / unique)
